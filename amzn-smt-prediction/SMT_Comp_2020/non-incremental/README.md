To run the SMT Comp scripts, download the benchmarks from [StarExec](https://www.starexec.org/starexec/secure/explore/spaces.jsp?id=406432) in space ``root/SMT/SMT-LIB benchmarks/2020-04-25/non-incremental/QF_SLIA`` and store them here.

Be sure that you download the entire hierarchy (not just the single space), and do not store benchmarks in id directories.
