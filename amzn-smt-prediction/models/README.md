# Models -- Training, Deployment, & Tarballs

Each subfolder within ``models/`` contains the code for training and
deploying each of the models. Notice that using this code will require
having AWS properly configured. The subfolders also contain tarballs
of the trained models which can be passed to a SageMaker Estimator in
order to deploy an endpoint and generate inferences.
